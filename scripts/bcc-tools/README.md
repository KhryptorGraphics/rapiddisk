# Kernel profiling using BCC tools

This directory contains assorted script files to profile rapiddisk module
functions utilizing the BCC suite.

In order to leverage these scripts you will need to ensure that the `bcc`
tools are installed on your system.

If you are building them from source, you can download the latest from:
`https://github.com/iovisor/bcc`

In Ubuntu, install `bcc` and `bpfcc-tools`.

In RedHat (and CentOS and Rocky Linux) install `bcc-tools`.
